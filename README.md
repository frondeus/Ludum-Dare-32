## About Game
You are lost in the maze. The only way is to go deeper. But this is maze! You don't know where is door and where is key. Find them! 
You can make new friends so they won't harm you. It's your only weapon. You must be very cute! 

Click (LMB) tile next to your character to move and make friends. WSAD, Arrow Keys and Numpad(only **v2**) also works.


## Known Bugs
* On Android devices touch event is triggered twice.
* **master**: Maze Procedural Generator is not working properly and it is incredible slow - fixed in **v2**
* **master**: AI enemies and allies is pretty dumb - fixed partially in **v2**
* I noticed strange horizontal lines on different resolutions.
